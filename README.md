Warro Maps - Navigator &amp; Tiler
http://warro.org

## Sponsored Grey-Cola-Chickened Speak from the author

A friend of mine created a map navigator using some jQuery scripts. His navigator needed some strange Python script to create the tiles, and when we finally makes it work, we realized a noob error: the tiling script and the map navigator were incompattible in many ways.

And here we are trying to get done a good GPL map navigator.

Anyway, if you'd like to help out, send us a pull request!!!

P.S.- Que viva El Dios Pollo! Yiiijaaa!!!

## Getting Started

- Git clone this rep
- Upload all the files to your web server
- Create two directories: ./maps, ./tiles  (REQUIRED)
- Drop a some, *** VERY *** big maps inside ./maps
- Set 777 permissions to ./maps and ./tiles
- Enjoy your big maps!!!

* `NOTE`: PHP's memory limit should be increased up to 256M to tile a 7200 x 3600px map. If you want to tile a bigger map, you'll need to pray to the Chicken God... Aleluya compadres!!!
